# GetAllTheItemsinator Python Practice
A test tool that allows for an easy look at where and how to manage every item in the game.

# Current projects:
- Update the code where CSV columns are referenced by a friendly name, not by their index.
- Add official item names (e.g. DIAMOND_AXE) to the item_list.csv file.
- Add a checklist feature that allows users to keep track of what they have found, and include simple stats.
